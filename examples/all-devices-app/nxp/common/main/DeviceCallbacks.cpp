/**
 * @file DeviceCallbacks.cpp
 *
 * Implements all the callbacks to the application from the CHIP Stack.
 * In a code-driven application the cluster attribute changes are handled
 * inside the cluster objects themselves, so this file only provides the
 * common device manager callbacks required by the NXP AppTaskBase.
